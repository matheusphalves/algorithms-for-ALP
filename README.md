Using metaheuristics approach to solve the Aircraft Landing Problem: static case.

Feel free to implement or enhance the current solvers, we will very be happy to add it.

## Solvers

### Multi runways

- ACO Solver
- ACO Parallel Solver (multithreading approach)

### Single runways

- GA Solver

## Utilities
- ACO GraphViewer
- ACO Report
- Math Utils
- Data Frame Handler
- ALP Parser

## Meta-heuristics approaches 

### Constructive

- Ant Colony Optimization

### Populational

- Genetic Algorithm



## About built-in Parser

The parser extracts information from Aircraft Landing Problem dataset from 
[OR-Library repository](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/airlandinfo.html).
